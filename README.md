# Linear-Regression
Single variable: Linear regression with a single variable attempts to model the relationship between a dependent variable y and an independent variable 𝑥 by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
Example 1: Predicting the weight of a fruit based on its diameter.
Example 2: Estimating the annual income based on the number of years of education.

Multiple variable: Multiple linear regression extends simple linear regression by using more than one independent variable to predict a dependent variable.
Example 1: Predicting car prices based on features like age, mileage, brand, and horsepower.
Example 2: Estimating a company's stock price using multiple financial indicators like earnings, revenue, and market conditions.

In the above code we use linear regression single variable, to determine per capita income by the years data ( we have yearly data of the per capita inome)
In the next code we use Linear regression multiple variable, to determine Price of the flat based on area, bedrooms and age of the house.
